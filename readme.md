# Cathode Colorschemes for Julia REPL
* using OhMyREPL to customize my REPL colors.
* should figure out how to fork/extend packages.
* Get a script into startup file good enough for now.
* Two kinds of schemes: 
    + cathode style uses many of the iterm ANSI color assignments
    + generic style uses fewer colors with bold/regular, where iterm scheme has many colors
* consider rainbow brackets off.
* try to get enclosed bracket underline to become bright instead.
